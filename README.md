This vDC for DigtalSTROM smarthome system provides an interface for Klafs Sauna App API. Tested with Klafs S1, but probably also with other models which can be controlled through the Klafs mobile app. 
The interaction between DigitalStrom system and this vDC is done bei calling Device Actions. You will see a new Device in the DigitalSTROM mobile app. 
Additionally the vDC sends some binary and sensor values to DigitalSTROM system which can be used through DigitalSTROM configurator (isPoweredOn, isReadyForUse, currentTemperature, currentHumidity, selectedSaunaTemperature, selectedSanariumTemperature).
